    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make ground chicken meatballs and coat them in seasoned Panko crumbs for a beautifully browned color.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups Italian-style panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground chicken</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons snipped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir egg, grated Parmesan cheese, 3/4 cup panko crumbs, garlic powder, Italian herb seasoning blend, crushed red pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Put on a pair of food-grade disposable gloves, add chicken to the bowl, and mix with your hands until all the ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Place remaining 1 cup panko crumbs on a plate. Using a 1-1/2-inch scoop, create about 24 meatballs. Gently roll each meatball in crumbs until lightly coated; set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add half the meatballs and brown each side, turning until all sides are browned. Set this batch on a plate, and wipe the skillet clean.</li>
        <li>Repeat with reserved oil and butter, and cook the remaining meatballs in the same way.</li>
        <li>Wipe out the skillet again, and pour in marinara sauce. Place browned meatballs in sauce. They will not be submerged.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Sprinkle on shredded mozzarella and return to the oven for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Sprinkle with fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>
